### Mini Graphs
The `\graph` command, also `\half-graph` and `\quarter-graph` for narrower versions, draws small graphs. You specify y values for x=0 and x=1 and also slopes after the command. You can string a number of these together to make a longer graph. The slopes are usually given using `/`, `\ ` and `=` for +1, -1 and 0 slopes. For example `\graph 1\1/` is 1 at 0 and 1, dips down then rises. 

> [!info]- Extended Syntax
You can instead use a slightly different syntax and separate the various components with a `:`. With that syntax you can use numbers for the slopes rather than the symbols. That's the way to get slopes other than +1, -1 and 0. `\graph 0.5:0.1:0.5:-0.1` is a graph at height 0.5 with a very slight rise in the middle.

The `\graph` command can give many more points on the curve. `\graph 0.5/0.5\0.5/0.5\0.5/0.5\0.5/0.5\` is an undulating graph at an average value of 0.5.

> [!info]- \UFO Future plans
> There's a much extended syntax in the works that gives more what you'd expect from a plotting library. It's not high priority because there are already good tools for doing graphs.)

The mini graphs are for very quick illustrations, such as ReLU, a cumulative distribution, Hermite polynomials in blending, illustration of square wave, triangular wave, sine wave, and so on.

### Twisty
The JaTeX command `\twisty` was originally designed just for Penrose notation. It shows how the order of items, indices for a tensor, is to change between its top and bottom edge. It can also draw the flat and squiggly lines needed to show symmetrisation and antisymmetrisation of tensors.

Originally `\twisty` was for two edges `\twisty top-bottom`, and you could specify the index order for the top, or the bottom, or both. However, it was natural to also offer connections between left and right edges. `\twisty top-bottom-left-right`. `\twisty` now gives us a general purpose tile for connecting things up. It can be used for electronics diagrams and some other things that involve connections.

Another extension to `twisty` is the option to use a `.` for an absent connection. This is mostly intended for wiring diagrams of various kinds. It can also be used to make a tile wider, or between indices to make the spacing between index lines wider.

### Grids
These are common in data science diagrams. `\grid` is followed by a sequence of letters such as `rgb,www`, which is specifying two rows, the first row with red, green and blue boxes and the second with three white boxes. 

A #UFO(future extension) will allow you to set your own custom letters. There's also a planned a custom version for chess.

### Transforms
These commands: `\flip`, `\fliph`, `\flipv`, `\flipminor`, `\rot90`, `\rot180`, `\rot270` and `\identity` will change the orientation of the next item - and for the flips there is a mirroring.
