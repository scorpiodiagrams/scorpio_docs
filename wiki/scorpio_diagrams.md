##Scorpio Diagrams - tl/dr;
!!Polyglot
Scorpio turns textual specifications into diagrams.

#### **Why? Who is it for?** 
I wrote Scorpio Diagrams to make annotated, information-rich infographics, particularly for biochemistry.

## Online Forge
The Diagram Forge page has some examples of Scorpio diagrams ready to adapt. Click on the diagram you would like to start from to start the editor.)
#### **How do I make diagrams?** 
Use the #TipLink(diagram_forge,online forge) and copy and modify simple examples.

## Information Cards
Info Cards are information boxes like this one that appear over your text or diagram.
)
#### **What features does it have?** 
* You can annotate diagrams. Use pop-up #TipLink(scorpio_cards,information cards) that show more information. Use the diagrams to organise information.
* The diagrams have modifiable automated layout. Modify the diagram by dragging its pieces into position. The text spec will be kept in sync.
* Scorpio Diagrams supports JaTeX, a LaTeX-like syntax for equations and diagrams. Make *and annotate* maths, chemical equations, genome structure, railway-diagrams, data science diagrams, mind-maps and numerous other kinds of graphic.

### More about 'Why'

Information-rich diagrams in biochemistry, electronics and computing present information that can be explored visually, but they can be labour intensive to make.  

If we make families of related diagrams, this reduces the overall work in making them. It is also good for consistency. Tools to make such diagrams make them easier to make and help the diagrams look and behave in a consistent way.

### More about 'How'

> [!info]- Diagram Forge

#### Modify Examples
The easiest diagrams to make are customisations of existing diagrams.  These can be made online at the 'diagram forge'. You can look at an example of what raw information the diagrams need, and cut and paste your own version of that text in.
