## Community
Community is gelling slowly and there are Discords and GitHub repos of interest to different people in the mix.

> Interested people are welcome to be involved in giving feedback on the plans, even if they can't or don't have time to participate through code.<br><br>The plans have different degrees of progress:<br><br>#Boat( - Once-working features from the past that are slated for some repair work when I have time to give them some attention.)<br>#Rock( - More immediate plans, often already with some code written or with a 'spike solution'.)<br>#UFO( - Longer term future plans that may not ever see the light of day.)

Scorpio re-uses ideas from multiple projects, and adapts them:

#Example(
* Mermaid Diagrams - Mermaid has some neat syntax.  The idea of using ( ), [ ], < > to specify end shapes is classy. I use this and several related ideas from Mermaid.
* d3.js - Is the most popular library for data driven diagrams.  The insight that thinking in terms of families of diagrams that are driven by data has been really helpful for Scorpio.  I've found it much more productive for the code I'm writing than working one at a time on one-off diagrams. 
* Arbital - Arbital wiki had many neat ideas, and had rich tooltip overviews of any page before Wikipedia did. Scorpio's info cards for annotating images and text are a similar idea.
* TiddlyWiki - Also inspired the info cards feature.  TiddlyWiki's cards are more fluid than Scorpio's are, and the flow of cards in TiddlyWiki suggest some future improvements I could make.
* Anki - Also inspired the info card feature. I intend that collections of the cards can capture points of interest and be used as an aid to learning.
* Scratch, SNAP & Blockly - Three outstanding educational programming environments. The snap together blocks pioneered by Scratch have inspired the labels feature of Scorpio.
* 3b1b and Manim - The mathematics videos by 3b1b are really cool.  I'm a fan.  Manim, written to make the 3b1b videos, has a ton of experience in it.  I've mined that code for ideas, and there is plenty more ideas from there yet to be used in Scorpio.
* LaTeX and KaTeX - For formatting mathematics, LaTeX is the standard whilst KaTeX makes the formatting web accessible.
* Standardised Markdown and Obsidian - The effort to make greater uniformity of markdown formats has been a big win. It's meant I can use an extended Markdown, without worrying that it will be too alien for users.
* Wikipathways - Collaborative editing and curating of large, referenced, visually oriented data, in a wiki.
* Google Maps and Open Street Maps - Insight into how to zoom and pan at scale, and motivating me to do so beyond geographical maps.
* Recursive Drawing - A neat interface for building larger images up from smaller ones.
* DatGui and Tangle - The transformative effect of flexible and easily created 'controllers' that DatGui has is behind the 'Controller' panel in Scorpio.  Tangle also gives ideas for how to make code that makes diagrams, with parameters that are easy to change.

To the many people responsible for these, and for other projects that I haven't given a shout out to here, but that have nevertheless influenced the design, a big Thank You.
