### Info Cards

Scorpio diagrams can add labels to diagrams and images. These labels can provide more detail with 'info cards' - additional text that appears when your mouse pointer is on the label. Hover over the green labels to see the info cards.

Scorpio can show info cards, like this one.  The cards stay out of the way, well away from the place where you hover.

> But did you know, a lot of moisture in the air is *below* clouds? Air cools and expands as it rises. We see the flat bottoms of clouds because it's where the water must condense out.
This card gets shown on the other side from the first one.

Each diagram has an info button in the top left.  This typically has general information about the diagram, including some copyright information.

Info cards can have hyperlinks in them. To get to the hyperlinks, move the mouse pointer reasonably quickly, to move it into the card without the card disappearing or moving away. 

The Immunology and Maxwell's Equations labels shown below have hyperlinks in their info cards.

If you move too slowly, the card will disappear. The intention is that info cards stay out of the way, that they provide additional information only for when you want to follow it.

> [!info]- Info Cards Elsewhere on the Internet
Scorpio info cards are a similar feature to the preview tips in Wikipedia, Obsidian and Arbital. They are also related to the idea of a master-detail display, where one panel gives detail on an overview. 

Some ways Scorpio info cards differ:
* They work on diagrams and images, not just on text. 
* Rather than be right next to the mouse pointer, they are kept some distance away, so as not to cover where you are mousing over.
* Scorpio's info cards use 'optical stability' to reduce the amount of flicker and 'jumping about' when you mouse-over different things. It's in how they move and the timing of how they change.
These are small changes that make the info cards more usable.)

> [!info]- The Info Button
The diagrams have an info button that appears in the top left hand corner when you're hovered over the diagram. Hover over this info button for an additional info card with copyright information.)

### Syntax of Diagrams
Scorpio Diagrams uses text instructions to specify a diagram. Instructions for making the diagram often have a '#Code(:)'' after them. Equations use JaTeX, a LaTeX like syntax. 

### Info Cards use Markdown
The diagram spec shown below has instructions for specifying two labels and a link between them. The info cards are specified at the end. The text of the cards is in Markdown format.
