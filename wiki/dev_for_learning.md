## Technology for Learning
Scorpio diagrams, I hope, will help transform Wikipidea from 'merely' an encyclopedia into a resource for active learning. 

Educational games can help with learning too.

There's another kind of technology that matters. Technology for helping people learn collaboratively. One version of that social technology is the 'Personal Learning Network'.

# PLNs
In a personal learning network people work to help each other learn. It can work like a study group where people meet regularly, someome leads the group, someone presents new material, comments discussion and feedback happen.

PLNs are social as well as practical.
