### Details Panel

The larger Scorpio diagrams have a #Code(Details) panel below them.

This panel has a list of all the hotspot zones in the diagram, so you can see where to click.  It also has buttons to customise the diagram and to edit it, if editing is enabled.

Beside the caption of the diagram, click on the '+ details' button to reveal the panel.
