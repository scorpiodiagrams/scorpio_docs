### Zoom in and out and Pan

With some diagrams you can zoom in and out, somewhat like 'Google maps'.  The map demo below is #Boat( an old demo, and currently a little broken.  You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.  The zoom centre is selected by wherever you last clicked.  You used also to be able to ctrl+drag the mouse to see different parts of the map. I will fix that as I work on the zooming feature.)

I've included the old demo to show the rulers at top and right.  They change continuously as you zoom, with new numbers and markers fading in and changing in size and weight.

For simple images zooming in or out just enlarges or shrinks the image.  

#Rock( The plan for custom diagrams is that more text and images appear as you zoom in, and the structure is simplified as you zoom out, rather than just a change in size.  All the example diagrams on this website are small, so it does not yet matter too much that the zoom feature is a work in progress.  )

 *uh... this does not pan and zoom yet*

The zooming and panning feature is intended to support large maps of biochemical pathways.

In the old example above, the zooming is with a mousewheel, and is into an image specified as a .png.

## Zooming into a Mindmap

The zooming feature works to an extent with mind maps, though without panning it is at this stage not useful to do.  

> To try out mindmap zooming, click on 'detail' in the caption for the image and then open the controller panel.  The two sliders allow sizing and rotation.  The text stays the same size and orientation.

#UFO(New labels appear as you zoom in.  Scorpio prevents further zooming in when there is no more detail to show.  This prevents a problem where you zoom a single pixel to be the whole screen, or zoom into empty space and 'lose' your diagram.)
