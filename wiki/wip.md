## Work in Progress I

These are all work in progress.

##Planets

⛵+#Rock(Warping an image round a sphere, and later around other shapes.). As well as warping, the code also does the planetary rotation. It would make more sense with WebGL. This is by direct pixel manipulation of the canvas.

##Fonts

#UFO(A skeleton font system, which I hope to work up into a font and emoji varigator.  You will get to select variations, blind-watchmaker fashion.)

One of the ideas is that serifs are like the end shapes.  I can use the same mechanism to customise serifs for a font as I use for end shapes.

     "setCaption","Font and Emoji Test",

  }

## To Be Announced
These two aren't so much styles as ways to change how Scorpio connects items in a bulleted list.

> #Code(##Snake) - #NUTC(TBA) 
#[ Snake : is about sequences of things rather than 'a tree of things'#]
> #Code(##Loop) - #NUTC(TBA) 
#[ Loop : is about 'grouping things into circles or cycles' rather than 'a tree of things'.#]
