## Diagram Forge

This page is for making new diagrams by adapting ready made diagrams. The diagrams below are like templates that you can edit.  Drag any label to reposition it.

When you drag a label you will see an #NUTC(edit box) appear to the side.  As you move the label around, you will be updating both visually and in text.  You can directly edit any of the text in that edit box and the diagram will update.  You can drag any label and the position for it noted in the text will update. It's a two-way connection.

#[Once you've got the hang of how the diagram and the text are related, you can make your own diagrams quickly by replacing the text with your own.

## Mind Maps

To make a mind map for a topic you are learning, type some words in to the edit box.  They should appear as new items on the diagram.  Next rearrange the items on the diagram by clicking and dragging.  To add links and change the styling, look at how it's done in the example.

Having made the basic structure you can make info cards with more information.  Look for #Code(card:) in the example to see how.

## Annotating an Image
You can also use Scorpio Diagrams to annotate an existing diagram.  Once again you make a list for the labels.  You can leave some labels empty, with just space in them, where you want to show a shape without any text in it.

Usually when making an annotated image you will first [upload](scorpio_details_panel) a background image so that you can position the labels on it.  When you've finished annotating the image you can [download](scorpio_details_panel) a copy.

In this example one annotation has been marked as a 'cloze question'. The normal annotation is temporarily obscured.
