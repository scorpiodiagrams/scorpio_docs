## Diagrams for Wikipedia
!!Polyglot
I intend that the interactive diagrams of Scorpio will be used in some form by Wikipedia.

I hope these diagrams will in time help to transform Wikipedia from an encyclopedic collection of knowledge into a map of knowledge with learning paths through it to explore.

### Low Road
Scorpio diagrams can already be produced and used in Wikipedia, as still images, without Wikipedia actually adopting the software.  The diagrams can be used right now.  They can be produced outside Wikipedia on a different website and imported as pngs (and later as SVG). This could be a route to progressive adoption.  It is for example easier to internationalize diagrams, if they are in the textual form rather than in the visual format. This 'Low Road' is still worthwhile.

### High Road
Scorpio's diagram software is available and openly licensed in such a way that Wikimedia Foundation can use it.  

There are specific concerns that matter for deploying Scorpio in Wikipedia.  Some of these are:
* Security - Any JavaScript needs to be 'safe'.
* Internationalization - It has to be easy to translate any user facing strings in the software.
* Low Server Load - The software should not require extensive processing on the server.
* Vandalism Aware - Existing Wikipedia mechanisms like 'templates' and 'bots' are particularly tempting to vandals, as they allow them to damage many pages at once.  Code also can allow vandalism to hide from vandalism detection.
* Cross Platform - The software must work on all major browsers including mobile, and should degrade gracefully on less capable platforms.

### No Road
It may be that Scorpio doesn't succeed in directly transforming Wikipedia.  One alternative route to adoption is that Scorpio might instead be used somewhat like an 'overlay journal', holding curated paths through Wikipedia and other open content. Possibly Wikipedia content can be distilled using large language models, to make variants with interactive diagrams.

Easy collaborative production of diagrams is a largely unmet need in Wikipedia.
