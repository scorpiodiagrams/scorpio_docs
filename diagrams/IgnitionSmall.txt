## ðŸš€Propellants
Rocket fuel needs to store considerable energy with low mass. Additives can:
* Make it safer to handle
* Make it burn more cleanly
* Reduce corrosion of the fuel tanks

## Additives
Because of high flow rates, catalysts and improvers need to be in the actual fuel itself. 

Above a certain percentage it becomes moot whether an 'additive' is an improver or actually part of the bulk fuel.

## HF
Small amounts of Hydrogen Fluoride decreases corrosion in some kinds of metal tank - and increases it in others.
:E:

## Silica
Silica can make some fuels thixotropic, so that they only flow when pressure is applied.  This makes the fuel safer to work with.
Powdered metals can have the same effect and also, because of the high temperatures reached, be part of the fuel.
