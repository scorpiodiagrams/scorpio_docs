#Audacity
Audacity generates raw data used by WIT.  For example, <a href="https://alphamanual.audacityteam.org/man/Extra_Menu:_Scriptables_II#get_info">Get Info</a> gets information about the menu structure and create a data file for that.  Audacity also generates the 'list of boxes' for the locations and dimensions of tool icons and toolbars.

#<a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/WIT_Audacity_Menus">WIT Menus</a>
Raw data that specifies the full tree-like structure of the Audacity menus.  There is an entry in the raw data for each menu item.
:C: at: 100,40
card:
#<a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/WIT_Audacity_Extra_Shortcuts">WIT Shortcuts</a>
Raw data listing the shortcuts.  Each shortcut is associated with a menu item.  Most of this data is in the menus file, so this list just lists the key combinations for optional shortcuts.
:D: at: 100,100
card:
#<a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/WIT_Audacity_Tooltips">WIT Tooltips</a>
Raw data, one item for each tooltip explaining what one menu item does.

#<a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Using_WIT">WIT</a>
<p>Wit is a web application that shows "What is That?" for many of the user interface features in Audacity.  It also has a hidden feature where it can generate images and tables for use in the Audacity manual.</p>
<p>Wit consumes information stored in our Wiki as raw JSON data, and produces images and formatted tables which can be uploaded to the wiki for our manual.

#Toolbar Images

</ul>

#File Upload
Small numbers of WIT-generated image files are uploaded to our wiki by hand.  For larger numbers, we use a <a href="https://github.com/JamesCrook/TeamTools/blob/master/docs/Wikibot.md">pywikibot script</a>.

#<a href="https://alphamanual.audacityteam.org/man/Main_Page">Alpha Manual</a>
The manual for the current alpha edition of Audacity is maintained in wiki.  When it is ready we use the <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/scripts/mw2html_audacity/mw2html.py">mw2html</a> script to convert it to static html pages, which are included with the Audacity installer, and also uploaded to the current online copy.

#<a href="https://github.com/JamesCrook/TeamTools/blob/master/docs/ImageScript.md">Scripting</a>
Audacity has a plug-in, mod-script-pipe, which accepts scripting commands sent over a pipe from python.  <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/scripts/piped-work/docimages_all.py">Python scripts</a> create and capture a large number of <a href="https://wit.audacityteam.org/images.htm">images of tracks</a>.
